        "\n",
        "🔹 2. Machine Learning–Based NER (NLTK)\n",
        "• Uses tokenization, POS tagging, and chunking\n",
        "• Pretrained statistical models\n",
        "• Better than rule-based, but limited context understanding\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 3. Deep Learning–Based NER (spaCy)\n",
        "• Uses neural networks and word embeddings\n",
